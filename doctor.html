        <div class="box">
            <h3>Can Covid-19 be transmitted through goods produced 
                in countries where there is ongoing transmission?</h3>
<p>Although it can last on surfaces for many hours, but the environment, 
    transportation and varying temperatures during shipment make it difficult 
    for the virus to remain active. If you feel the surface may be contaminated, 
    clean it with a disinfectant and wash your hands after touching it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Can drinking alcohol help prevent Covid-19?</h3>
            <p>Drinking alcohol, such as beer, liquor, wine doesnâ€™t help prevent coronavirus. 
                You should wash your hands often, wear masks, and avoid being close to 
                those with a fever and cough</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Is it true that Covid-19 is transmitted in cold 
                climate and not in hot and humid climate?</h3>
            <p>Coronavirus 2019 can be transmitted in any kind of climate. 
                Wherever you are, no matter what kind of climate, you have to practice 
                personal hygiene, i.e. wash your hands often, cover your mouth 
                when you sneeze or cough, and wear masks</p>

            <h3>Can digital thermometers be 100% effective 
                in detecting Covid-19 patients?</h3>
            <p>It may take the virus 1-14 days 
                to incubate and cause symptoms 
                like a fever, so it cannot be used 
                to identify asymptomatic patients</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h3>Can eating garlic prevent covid-19?</h3>
            <p>Though garlic has some anti-microbial properties, there is 
                no evidence that it can prevent Covid-19</p>
